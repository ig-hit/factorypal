= image:images/factorypal.png[FactoryPal, 30] Code Challenge: Speed Metrics Service

== Intro
FactoryPal is receiving in realtime the running speed of production machineries. We would like
to generate some useful metrics for our users and for this we want to build a metrics service.

== The Challenge

We would like to have a restful API to calculate machine data in real time. The service is with the following functionalities:

- Load machine data from provided CSV file and store it into a datastore. The format of one machine data entry is as follows:

Request body:
[source, json]
----
{ "key": "embosser", "name": "Embosser" }
----

- Provide an endpoint that inserts machine parameters data into the datastore with the following format:

Request body:
[source, json]
----
{  "machineKey": "embosser", "parameters": {"core_diameter": 3, "speed": 20 }}
----

- Provide an endpoint that exposes the latest parameters for every machine.

- Provide an endpoint that exposes the average, median, min and max of each parameters for the past N minutes for every machine.

== Requirements

* The API has to function properly.
* The project should be buildable and runnable.
* There should be unit tests and integration tests, which run successfully.
* Since this service runs internally, security is not a concern.
